Hi Viewer,

I am creating this readme file on how to execute the script.

1. Pull the script and the files in your local.
2. If you want to use the script with hardware, get a raspberrypi 3.0
3. Raspberry Pi 3.0, Camera module, and a small speaker with 2 pin output.
4. Install the script on Raspberry PI.
5. trigger the batch file as soon as raspberryPI get powered.
6. I have abstracted quit button, due to it's using scenario(should be monitoring drivers face all the time).

Facial Landmark file is uploaded separately on the below drive link, it is required for script to work.
